## Notes
- Only 'master' branch has been used. In real build, feature branches would be used in conjunction with a dev site with 'master' reserved for production code only.
- Please note the responsive-property() mixin. This uses the grid breakpoints to calculate a scaled CSS value, allowing any numerical CSS value to responsively scale in sync with all other on the site.
- Design: 9 different shades of grey are used, seems unnecessary/could be more consistent.
- Headings font: Medium looked more like design over Bold. This may be due to not being the Pro version of the font.
