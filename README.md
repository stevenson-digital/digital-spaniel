## Notes
- Only 'master' branch has been used. In a real build I would use feature branches in conjunction with a dev site with 'master' reserved for production code only.
- Please note the responsive-property() mixin. This uses the grid breakpoints to calculate a scaled CSS value, allowing any numerical CSS value to responsively scale in sync with all others on the site (font-size, margin, padding, etc. all scaling in harmony). 1600px and above will show fixed desktop size from the design. 640px and below will show a fixed mobile size (determined by me), and then anything inbetween those breakpoints will be a calculated, scaled, size that is between the desktop/mobile values.
- Design: 9 different shades of grey are used, seems unnecessary/could be more consistent.
- Headings font: Medium looked more like design over Bold. This may be due to not being the Pro version of the font.
- Site is not SSR.
- No 404 error page.
- useScrollPosition hook not written by me (https://github.com/n8tb1t/use-scroll-position).
- Design: Social media icons were not downloadable SVGs via XD so I've used my own ones (just a heads up if they're not an exact match)
- BurgerMenu toggles based on Redux state (using hooks).
- FullscreenOverlay would be extended if a full site so that it stores which component is on top (ie BurgerMenu or Modal). In this way, you can click on it to close whichever component is overlaid. Currently hardcoded to always close BurgerMenu.
- Site is hosted on Netlify.
